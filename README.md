Hi there, 

This is my first study project following a **full product life-cycle development**.

This work started by the ideation of finding a solution to help students in their everyday studies. I wanted to create a new learning tool to be more accurate in their way of learning. 

So the start of this work was the **discovery phase** :

The first step was to understand how students approach their work in order to develop a learning tool that provides maximum value to users. 
I began by casually asking my friends about their study habits. Then, I sent a survey to my classmates to gather a broader range of responses to questions I had in mind. This survey helped me **validate** some of my initial assumptions.

For exemple, I asked them what they do if they don't understand  on topic in the course or the full course and that's the answer that I had :

**100%** watch a youtube video ! Now, we know that Youtube is a main vector in their way of studing. 

Also, 84% of them use AI like Chat GPT to help them in their studies.

75% of them redoing exercice viewed in class to train themself and be sure that they understand.
