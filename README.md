Hi there, 

This is my first study project following a **full product life-cycle development**.

This work started by the ideation of finding a solution to help students in their everyday studies. I wanted to create a new learning tool to be more accurate in their way of learning. 

So the start of this work was the **discovery phase** :

The first step was to understand how students approach their work in order to develop a learning tool that provides maximum value to users. 
I began by casually asking my friends about their study habits. Then, I sent a survey to my classmates to gather a broader range of responses to questions I had in mind. This survey helped me **validate** some of my initial assumptions.

For exemple, I asked them what they do if they don't understand  on topic in the course or the full course and that's the answer that I had :

**100%** watch a youtube video ! Now, we know that Youtube is a main vector in their way of studing. 

Also, 84% of them use AI like Chat GPT to help them in their studies.

75% of them redoing exercice viewed in class to train themself and be sure that they understand.

After conducting surveys and interviewing friends and classmates, I decided to develop a RAG AI application to organize AI-driven knowledge and provide prescriptive analysis for students : **the building phase**

The priciple of RAG is very easy to understand :

The model will break the text into chunks and store them in a vector database, enabling the LLM to base its responses on the provided document. This process helps avoid hallucinations, enhancing the reliability of the answers for students.

Additionally, I recognized the need to integrate YouTube search functionality. Through the survey, I discovered how important videos are for students to fully understand the topics they‚Äôre studying, so I added a search video button :

Finally I discovered a very usefull use case of Gen AI for studying : the possibility of generate quizz based on the document provided. It allow to test your own knoledge on the course and showing you what you need to improve to be ready for the test. That's why I added a quizz button : ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37d0fca9-4ffb-481b-8589-88d8070e4457)

For the moment, I didn't let other try and test my app, so I would give more insight about the lauch and evaluating phase in few weeks to have time to get user feedback.
